# Version-Controlled DevOps Project

## Objective
This project demonstrates managing a DevOps project using Git best practices:
- Initialize repo and push to GitHub
- Create and manage `dev`, `feature`, and `main` branches
- Use Pull Requests to merge code
- Use `.gitignore` to exclude files
- Use tags for versioning
- Document tasks using markdown files

---

## Branch Strategy
- `main`: Production-ready code
- `dev`: Integration branch where features are merged first
- `feature/*`: Feature branches for development

---

## How to Use
1. Clone the repo
2. Work on `feature` branch
3. Open Pull Request to merge into `dev`
4. Merge `dev` into `main` when stable
5. Tag releases using semantic versioning (e.g., `v1.0.0`)
